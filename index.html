              <p>My name is Ian Koech. I am currently taking my degree in computer science
              at Kenyatta University. I am also taking a software development prep class in Moringa School.
              I am taking this course in order to get the necessary skills to become a web developer
              and hopefully land clients to create websites for and maybe get an internship before
              further diving into software development to become a full-stack  developer.</p>
